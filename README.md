ANTrackBar
==========

ANTrackBar is an open-source, easy to use Cocoa tracking bar, similar to the seek bar in VLC 2.0. All graphics are drawn with code, making the use of this class a single drag-and-drop operation. *No resources need to be copied!* Usage is straight forward, just see `ANAppDelegate.m`.
